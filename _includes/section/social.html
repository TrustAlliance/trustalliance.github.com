                    </h1>
                    <p>
                        With growing investment in research and development of digital identity solutions, there has been a corresponding growth in efforts to define ‘good’ identity in digital contexts.<br><br>

                        The Trust Alliance builds on approaches and knowledge developed by WEF, ON and ID2020 by using ‘humanity first’ as a guiding principle in everything that we do, going beyond human-centred to humanity-centred design to ensure people are at the centre and in control of their digital identity.
